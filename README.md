# Hi!
As you all know by now, physics has taken over 87% of all my waking thoughts (and yes, it's incredibly fun). 

One class, I realised that Unity has a really good physics engine, almost as good as the real world. I reckoned I could use this fun little fact to:
1. Practice my physics and coding at the same time
2. Create a cool way to generate physics problems
3. Develop a physics sandbox for fun experimentation
4. Lose my mind along the way!


# Why?
Why not? I get to flex that I know my way around Unity, and we all get a (hopefully) fantastic resource to use while studying for those pesky tests.

On top of being a super cool "game," I've made sure that this entire project is open-source. This means that any of you who want to give a try at making some changes or adding some features yourself are more than free to try! Don't worry, though, there is also a [suggestion box](https://forms.gle/UWWK5iXtoMgLHNcj7) for those of you who see something that needs to be changed or added, but have no idea how to code.
